Graph 1: Heat Map (Temperature vs Humidity)
-------------------------------------------
- We have chosen this map so that we are able to identify trends and correlation between Temperature and Humidity in the current location that we are in. This provides insight into what kind of crops we can grow in this particular climate and the relation to Humidity that the Temperature has on it.
- In the graph we are representing Temperature on the x axis and Humidity on the y axis.
- For this graph we have used the Seaborn library.
- The Seaborn library allows create high resolution complex graphs in colour. There is alot of flexability in Seaborn allowing you to create relational, categorical, distributional, regressional and matrix plots, as well as offering a range of style control, colour palettes and widgets. All these complex functions are great aside from the fact that it is not very easy to install on a raspberry pi. The Seaborn library has few dependancies but each need to be installed individually or it fails to install the library as it times out while installing.

Graph 2: 
-------------------------------------------
- We have chosen this graph so that we can see the relationship between Temperature over time as it is easier to analyse trends in tempearture over time from plots
- We are plotting tempearture vs time graph. This shows us trend of tempearture over given time
- We use Matplotlib library for this graph
- Advantages of using this library is that it was very simple and easy to use and has support for rasberry pi. The configuration was easy and there were alot of ways we can visualse data.
